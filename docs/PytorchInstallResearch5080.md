### Key Recommendations for Installing PyTorch on Windows 11 with ASUS RTX 5080

- Research suggests that the RTX 5080 (Blackwell architecture, sm_120 compute capability) may require PyTorch nightly builds for full compatibility, as stable versions like 2.7.0 often show warnings about unsupported architectures, though some users report success with updates by mid-2025.
- Evidence leans toward starting with the latest NVIDIA drivers and CUDA 12.8 or higher, but the PyTorch package typically includes necessary runtime libraries, making a full CUDA Toolkit install optional unless building from source.
- It seems likely that basic GPU-accelerated tasks work with nightly installs, but for stability in production, consider building from source if issues arise—user experiences vary, with some achieving seamless setups and others needing patches.

#### Prerequisites

- Update Windows 11 to the latest version for compatibility.
- Install Python 3.9–3.13 (recommend 3.12 or 3.13 for best support).
- Download and install the latest NVIDIA Game Ready or Studio Driver for RTX 5080 (version 576.02 or newer, such as 581.15) from [NVIDIA's driver download page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).
- Optionally, install CUDA Toolkit 12.8 or 12.9 if planning advanced development or source builds; download from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

#### Installation Steps

1. **Set Up Python Environment**: Install Python from the official site, add to PATH, and create a virtual environment using `python -m venv myenv` then activate it with `myenv\Scripts\activate`.
2. **Install PyTorch**: Use the command for stable if compatible, or nightly for RTX 50-series support: `pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128` (for CUDA 12.8).
3. **Verify Installation**: Run `import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())` in Python—it should return True without sm_120 warnings. If warnings appear, switch to nightly or build from source.

#### Common Issues and Fixes

If you encounter "sm_120 not compatible" errors, update to nightly builds or apply patches as discussed in community guides—many users resolve this diplomatically by testing versions without major conflicts.

### Comprehensive Guide to Installing PyTorch on Windows 11 with ASUS RTX 5080 NVIDIA GPU

The ASUS RTX 5080, part of NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture (compute capability sm_120), represents a high-end consumer GPU released in early 2025, optimized for AI, gaming, and creative workloads. Installing PyTorch—a popular open-source machine learning framework—on Windows 11 with this GPU enables GPU-accelerated training and inference, leveraging features like CUDA for significant performance gains. However, as of August 31, 2025, compatibility challenges arise due to the new sm_120 architecture: stable PyTorch versions (e.g., 2.7.0) often lack pre-built support, triggering warnings like "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with CUDA capability sm_120 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation." This guide synthesizes official documentation, developer forums, and user experiences to provide a step-by-step process, emphasizing nightly builds or source compilation for full compatibility. While PyTorch includes CUDA runtime in its packages (negating the need for a separate Toolkit install for basic use), advanced setups may require it. We'll cover prerequisites, installation variants, verification, troubleshooting, and best practices, drawing from reliable sources to ensure accuracy.

#### Understanding Compatibility and Requirements

The RTX 5080 requires CUDA 12.8 or higher for full functionality, as earlier versions lack Blackwell support. PyTorch 2.7.0 officially supports CUDA 12.8, but its binaries are compiled for older architectures (e.g., sm_50 to sm_90), excluding sm_120. This leads to runtime warnings and potential kernel failures. Nightly builds, updated daily, incorporate sm_120 support since early 2025, making them the go-to for RTX 50-series users. Building from source offers customization but demands more setup.

System requirements include:

- Windows 11 (fully updated to avoid driver conflicts).
- Python 3.9–3.13 (avoid 3.8 or older due to deprecation).
- At least 16GB RAM (RTX 5080 has 16GB GDDR7 VRAM, ideal for large models).
- NVIDIA driver version 572.16 or later (e.g., 576.02 for game-ready optimizations or 581.15 WHQL for stability).
- Optional: Visual Studio Community (for CUDA development tools) and CUDA Toolkit 12.8/12.9.

A comparison of PyTorch versions for RTX 5080:

| Version Type | CUDA Support | sm_120 Compatibility | Pros | Cons | Recommended For |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|------|------|-----------------|
| Stable (2.7.0) | Up to 12.8 | Partial/Limited (warnings common) | Easy install, reliable for older GPUs | Architecture mismatches, potential errors | Testing if no issues; fallback to nightly |
| Nightly | Up to 12.9 | Full (since Q1 2025) | Latest features, Blackwell optimizations | Less stable, frequent updates needed | RTX 50-series users seeking immediate support |
| Source Build | Custom (12.8+) | Full (with patches) | Tailored to hardware, max performance | Time-consuming, requires dev tools | Advanced users or when nightly fails |

User reports indicate that by mid-2025, stable releases began incorporating Blackwell fixes, but persistent issues in forums up to July suggest verifying with the latest.

#### Step-by-Step Installation Process

Follow these steps sequentially. Use Command Prompt or PowerShell as administrator for installations.

1. **Update Windows and Install NVIDIA Driver**:
   - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and install all updates.
   - Download the driver from [NVIDIA's site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx): Select GeForce > RTX 50 Series > RTX 5080 > Windows 11 > Game Ready or Studio.
   - Run the installer, choose Custom > Clean Install, and reboot.
   - Verify: Open Command Prompt, run `nvidia-smi`—it should list RTX 5080 with CUDA version 12.8+.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (e.g., 3.12.5 or 3.13.3).
   - Check "Add Python to PATH" during install.
   - Verify: `python --version`.

3. **Optional: Install CUDA Toolkit**:
   - If building from source or using other CUDA apps, download CUDA 12.8/12.9 from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
   - Select Windows > x86_64 > 11 > exe (local).
   - Custom install: Include Development, Runtime, and Visual Studio Integration (install Visual Studio first if needed).
   - Add to PATH: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8\bin`.
   - Verify: `nvcc --version`.

4. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   - `python -m venv pytorch_env`
   - Activate: `pytorch_env\Scripts\activate`
   - Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

5. **Install PyTorch**:
   - For stable (if compatible): `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
   - For nightly (recommended for sm_120): `pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128`
   - If using Conda: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=12.8 -c pytorch` (but pip is preferred for Windows).

6. **Alternative: Build from Source (for Full Customization)**:
   - Install Visual Studio Community with C++ tools.
   - Clone PyTorch: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch`
   - Apply Blackwell patch if needed (e.g., from community repos).
   - Set `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="9.0;12.0"` (for Blackwell).
   - Build: `python setup.py install`.
   - This resolves sm_120 issues but takes 1–2 hours.

#### Verification and Testing

- Basic check: In Python, `import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))`—expect True and "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080" without warnings.
- Advanced: Run a tensor on GPU: `x = torch.rand(5, 3).cuda(); print(x)`.
- If false or warnings: Reinstall driver, check PATH, or switch to nightly.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **sm_120 Warning**: Switch to nightly or source build; update driver to 576+.
- **GPU Not Detected**: Run `nvidia-smi`; reinstall driver cleanly.
- **Missing DLLs (e.g., cufft64_12.dll)**: Install full CUDA Toolkit.
- **Install Fails**: Use virtual env; ensure no conflicting PyTorch versions.
- For tools like Stable Diffusion or ComfyUI: Update to Blackwell-compatible forks.
- WSL2 Alternative: For better Linux compatibility, install via WSL2 with Anaconda.
